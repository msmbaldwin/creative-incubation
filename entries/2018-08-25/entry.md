This is entire entry is going to cover PAX-Dev and PAX which will last
around a week and a half.

## Game Idea

Today while listening to podcasts a game idea came into my head. The
background for this is two weeks of playing
[Lowlands](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/242804/lowlands). The
key mechanic of the game is the dike building vs. the sheep
building. If players contribute to the dike then the dike holds, sheep
are worth more, and dike contributing is worth less. If players
produce sheep then the dike fails and sheep are worth less and dike
contributions are worth more. It's more subtle than this but this
mechanic ands some interesting interaction to an otherwise
multiple-player solitaire game without adding excessive politics.

One podcast I listend to was a [freakonomics
podcast](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/save-the-planet/) that
described the two sides of the ecology debate as prophets (doom is
coming and we must stop doing things) and wizards (we must build all
kinds of things to bring improvents and fix the problems cause by the
things we build).

A second podcast talked about how there are different kinds of leaders
but there are also followers and there must always be followers to get
something accomplished.

The game idea is that there is a community where you can choose the
role of wizard, prophet or follower. Wizards and Prophets are
generally opposed. Followers must choose a Wizard or Prophet to
follow. Somehow the actions affect a communal games state, improve
future actions, and allow for VP. This is all I have so far.

I've had problems with genre in the past. So that I don't pick a
problematic genre too soon, let's go through a list of genres and try to find roles for Wizard, Prophet and Follower.

| Genre                | Prophet    | Wizard      | Follower |
| --                   | --         | --          | --       |
| Age of Reason        |            |             |          |
| American Civil War   |            |             |          |
| American Indian Wars |            |             |          |
| American Rev War     |            |             |          |
| Amererican West      | Cowboys    | Settlers    |          |
| Ancient (300 BC)     | Shaman     |             |          |
| Ancient Egypt        | Priest     |             | Pharoah  |
| Arabian              |            |             |          |
| Environmental        |            |             |          |
| Fantasy              | Cleric     | Wizard      | King     |
| Farming              |            |             |          |
| Horror               | Science    | Exorsist    |          |
| Mafia                |            |             |          |
| Medieval             |            |             |          |
| Napoleanic           | Revolution | Aristocracy | Mob      |
| Nautical             | Greenpeace | Whalers     |          |
| Pirates              |            |             |          |
| Political            |            |             |          |
| Religious            |            |             |          |
| Renaissance          | Church     | Science/Art | Prince   |
| Sci Fi               |            |             |          |
|                      |            |             |          |
|                      |            |             |          |
|                      |            |             |          |
|                      |            |             |          |

Trying a different take on this. Instead of starting with the theme,
let's start with the basic mechanics and go from there. Starting with
four players and 3 cards: wizard, prophet, follower, let's see how we
can play these in a round and device a working game with minimal
mechanics.

I used squib to [mock up some cards](https://github.com/sizezero/stone-flood).

A two round play where each player plays a single card over two
rounds. Players can play in the first or second round. Playing a card
early means it is unbound. Playing a card late means it must bind with
an appropriate type if possible. The second player chooses the bind if
choices are available.

Eric has some ideas.

- reminds him of Modern Art
- imagined having more cards, perhaps a hand
- thought about having a secret action that may come in
- thinks it would be easier to have a game in mind that models this mechanic
